<h2>📰 Published Research Projects </h2>
My previous research studied reinforcement learning by eulcidating how natural neural networks guide deicion making in rodents. This entailed recording neuronal activity from real neuronal circuits and then interpreting them through often complex analyses.  

- <b> Signal Processing of Brainwave data (aka Calcium Fiber photometry) </b>
  - pMAT
  - VTA glutamatergic neurons mediate innate defensive behaviors
  - Distinct Signaling by Ventral Tegmental Area Glutamate, GABA, and Combinatorial Glutamate-GABA Neurons in Motivated Behavior
  - Regulation of social interaction in mice by a frontostriatal circuit modulated by established hierarchical relationships
  - A stress-sensitive frontostriatal circuit supporting effortful reward-seeking behavior
  - Lateral preoptic area glutamate neurons relay nociceptive information to the ventral tegmental area

- <b> Analysis of single-unit neuronal recording data (in vivo electrophysiology & in vivo two-photon imaging) </b>
  - Aversion or salience signaling by ventral tegmental area glutamate neurons
  - Acquired Alterations in Nucleus Accumbens Responsiveness to a Cocaine-Paired Discriminative Stimulus Preceding Rats’ Daily Cocaine Consumption
 
- <b> Analysis of behavior </b>
  - Emergence of negative affect as motivation for drug taking in rats chronically self-administering cocaine
