<h1> Hi, my name is David. Welcome to my code repository! </h1>
I am a Computational Neuroscientist :brain: seeking positions as a Machine Learning Engineer. Through my research, I study reinforcement learning (RL) in both real and artificial neural networks. I am particularly facinated by Deep Q-Learning and its applications in Neuroscience. I am also facinated by the use of NeuroAI in medicine and robotics. 

<h2> 👨‍🔬 Active Research Projects:</h2>

- <b> 🥼 Chronic Stress Influences Prefrontal Threat Response and Afferent Connectivity </b> - Project coming soon

- <b> 🤖 DQN as a model of synaptic turnover 🤖 </b> - Code repository available by request

<h2>👨‍💻 Active Code Repositories:</h2>

- <b> 🔦 [BrainBeam](https://github.com/DJESTRIN/BrainBeam) 🔦</b> - A cloud computing pipeline for analyzing whole-brain lightsheet datasets at petabyte scale. Contains a full pipeline for analyses. Currently developing associated GUI + API.

- <b> 🔬 [Sweet2Plus](https://github.com/DJESTRIN/Sweet2Plus) 🔬</b> - A python API for analysis of suite2P outputs. In addition to analyzing suite2P outputs and performing statistics, this repo contains some C++ code for running behavioral experiments in the wet lab. 

- <b> 🖥️ [LinReg](https://github.com/DJESTRIN/LinReg) 🖥️ </b> - A unifying linear regression library. This repository contains R and SAS functions/scripts for generalized linear mixed models, linear mixed models, linear models. I am currently building this repository based on a variety of statistics scripts I have written over the years. In addition to regression analyses, there are some common functions for plotting and data cleaning.

<h2>📰 Published Research Projects: </h2>
My previous research studied reinforcement learning by eulcidating how natural neural networks guide deicion making in rodents. This entailed recording neuronal activity from real neuronal circuits and then interpreting them through often complex analyses.
